              An avid fantasy player with experience in the sports journalism and design, Paul founded Hoopdex with the aim of providing fantasy basketball fans of all levels the most intuitive data resource. Seeing a need for easily digestible content, Paul combined thorough player writeups with past statistics to form an all-in-one dashboard, providing a holistic understanding of each player at minimal effort to fantasy managers. In his spare time, Paul enjoys cooking, walking his dog and reminiscing on the glorious days of the 2011 Dallas Mavericks.
